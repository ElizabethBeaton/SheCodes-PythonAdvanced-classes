What is object-oriented programming?
in order to model our code or anything we'd lik to create wth the code
class, object, properties and methods
eg: class - a categery of something or things, eg a car, human, tree, bird, piano, computer
and then each class has different objects, this is what makes it unique. eg i the class is human, the object could be 'name'
as we all have different names, similarily we could have different heights
a class is a thing we can group different objects in it. and then the object is an instance of this class
Each object can also have different properties. this can be your first and last name, height, colour of eyes, origin etc. 
each object has different properties.
another example: a car could be the name of a class, the object could be a your car and the car of your neightbour for eg, and then properties could
be colour, brand, year is was bought etc
each object also has methods - this is what an object can do. 
eg in the real world a human can eat, sleep, walk, talk etc.
similarly, a car can drive, be stopped, be parked etc - actions the car can do
